# CSE 15l Lab Report 3 - Kiko Pan 

The command that I will be researching further in lab report 3 is the ```find``` command. 

1. One way you can use the ```find``` command is with the ```-name``` option. ```find``` is used to locate files and directories. Adding the ```-name``` command along with find searches for the specific file name path. For example, running ```find . -name chapter-1.txt``` searches the current directory for a file that matches the file name given after the ```-name```. It then returns the path that matches the file name and if there isn't anything that matches, it returns nothing.
